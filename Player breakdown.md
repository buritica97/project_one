Intro:












Does buying the big name player bring a large ROI?

The short answer is not necessarily. After looking at the production levels of midfield and forward position players, it was determined that some of the most<br> expensive players were not actually worth the price paid in terms of production on the field. Neymar is the perfect example of a player that came with<br> a high price tag but has not been as productive in his tenure at PSG. Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡ was acquired for a much lower fee and had a higher rate of production. However,<br> acquiring the big-name player does put fans in the stands and bring media attention to the club. This does need to be factored into the ROI of a player<br> that is being considered for acquisition.
